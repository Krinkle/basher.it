Lightweight workspace manager for the shell.

Desk makes it easy to flip back and forth between different project contexts in your favorite shell. Change directory, activate a `virtualenv` or `rvm`, load in domain-specific aliases, environment variables, functions, arbitrary shell files, all in a single command.
