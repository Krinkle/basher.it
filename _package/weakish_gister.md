Based on gist.rb by @defunkt, this tool helps you to manage a local copy of your gists.

After publishing files to gist.github.com, this tool will:

* automatically clone the gist repository to local
* index the content of your gist for code search
* fetch meta info (e.g. description, url) of the gist from GitHub and add them to gists.list.
