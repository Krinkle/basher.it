SHML (SHell Markup Language) is a shell framework for faster and easier script development.

HTML has CSS, terminals have "ANSI/VT100 Control Sequences". SHML makes is easy to apply some style to your shell scripts without trying to remember that Yellow = \033[33m instead Yellow is $(color yellow).
