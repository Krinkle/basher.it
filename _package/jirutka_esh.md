esh (embedded shell) is a templating engine for evaluating shell commands embedded in arbitrary templates. Itâ€™s like ERB (Embedded RuBy) for shell, intended to be used for templating configuration files. Unlike ERB it provides support for including one ESH template into another (since version 0.2.0).
