Sub is a model for setting up shell programs that use subcommands, like git or rbenv using bash. Making a sub does not require you to write shell scripts in `bash`, you can write subcommands in any scripting language you prefer.

A sub program is run at the command line using this style:

    $ [name of program] [subcommand] [(args)]
