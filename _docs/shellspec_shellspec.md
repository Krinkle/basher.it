ShellSpec is a full-featured BDD unit testing framework for dash, bash, ksh, zsh and all POSIX shells that provides first-class features such as code coverage, mocking, parallel execution, parameterized testing and more. It was developed as a dev/test tool for cross-platform shell scripts and shell script libraries. With lots of practical CLI features and simple yet powerful syntax, it provides you with a fun shell script test environment.
