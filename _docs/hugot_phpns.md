Phpns is a command line interface for the management and indexation of namespaces in PHP projects. It is written in bash and mainly makes use of grep to index the namespaces and classes that are present in a directory. Using this index, Phpns can parse a PHP file and add missing use statements, complete Fully Qualified Names (FQN's) of namespaces and classes, and more!
