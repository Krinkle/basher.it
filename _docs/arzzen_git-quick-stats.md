git-quick-stats is a simple and efficient way to access various statistics in a git repository.

Any git repository may contain tons of information about commits, contributors, and files. Extracting this information is not always trivial, mostly because there are a gadzillion options to a gadzillion git commands – I don’t think there is a single person alive who knows them all. Probably not even Linus Torvalds himself :).
 
## Usage
 
 	# interactive
	git-quick-stats

or

	# non-interactive
	git-quick-stats <optional-command-to-execute-directly>
