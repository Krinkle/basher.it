# basher packages

![](assets/img/basher.jpg)

[basher]() is one of the best package managers for the bash langauge. It works a bit like composer for PHP or npm for Node. 

But it only does the installing, it doesn’t provide a directory of packages that can be installed with it. This is partly because it is clever enough to figure out what to do once it clones a repo, which scripts should be made globally available.

Still, I thought it would be cool to also have a list of certified-works-with-basher repos. Find it on [basher-packages.forret.com](https://basher-packages.forret.com/). It is far from complete, but it gives you an idea of what kind of bash tools exist.
