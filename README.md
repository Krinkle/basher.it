# basher packages

[basher](https://www.basher.it) is one of the best package managers for the bash scripting language. It works a bit like composer for PHP or npm for Node. 

But it only does the installing, it doesnâ€™t provide a directory of packages that can be installed with it. This is partly because it is smart.

Still, I thought it would be cool to also have a list of certified-works-with-basher repos. Find it on [basher.gitparade.com](https://basher.gitparade.com/). It is far from complete, but it gives you an idea of what kind of bash tools exist.
