[basherpm/basher](https://github.com/basherpm/basher) is one of the best **package managers for the bash scripting language**.

It works like `composer` for PHP or `npm` for Node: just the `basher install <user>/<package>` command will download a (bash) package from Github and put the script in your path. It can also take care of uninstalling and updating.

## Who is behind basher?

Basher was started in 2013 by [Juan Ibiapina](https://github.com/juanibiapina) . There are currently [more than a dozen other contributors](https://github.com/basherpm/basher/graphs/contributors) to the package. The basher.it website (2021) and the package directory (2020) are contributions of [Peter Forret](https://github.com/pforret).
