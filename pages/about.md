[basher](https://github.com/basherpm/basher) is one of the best package managers for the bash langauge.
It works a bit like composer for PHP or npm for Node. But it only does the installingm it doesn't provide a directory of packages that can be installed with it. 
This is partly because it is clever enough to figure out what to do once it clones a repo, which scripts should be mage globally available.

Still, I thought it would be cool to also have a list of certified-works-with-basher repos. This is it. It is far from complete, but it gives you an idea of what kind of bash tools exist.
