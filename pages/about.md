## Basher
[basherpm/basher](https://github.com/basherpm/basher) is one of the best package managers for the bash scripting language.

It works like `composer` for PHP or `npm` for Node: just the `basher install <user>/<package>` command will download a (bash) package from Github and put the script in your path. It can also take care of uninstalling and updating.

But it only does the installing, there is no directory of packages that can be installed with it 
(like [packagist.org](https://packagist.org/) for PHP, [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) for Node, [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/) for Python).

So this is exactly that, a repository of `basher install` compatible bash packages.


## Shield 

If you've also developed a script that also can be installed with basher, feel free to add the `basher install` shield to your repo and link back to this site.
