PHP has packagist.com, Node have npmjs.com, Python has pypi.org, Rust has crates.io. It is only normal that `basher`, as the main **bash package manager**, also gets its own website.

So Juan and me (Peter) agreed to set up [basher.it](https://www.basher.it). This site will be the main site for the basher project.
